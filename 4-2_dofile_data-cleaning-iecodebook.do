/* 

iecodebook is a command from the Stata package "iefieldkit" created by DIME Analytics

iecodebook allows the to automatically perform the repetitive steps involved in cleaning data before further analysis. 

The command "iecodebook" is particularly useful to 
	1. Drop variables in the dataset that are not going to be used
	2. Re-label variable description in the dataset from spanish to english
	3. Recode variables in your dataset.

iecodebooks allow researchers to document the cleaned data in a format that is both human and machine-readable.

To install the command "iecodebook", you need to ask stata to install the pacakge "iefieldkit" using the following command
ssc install iefieldkit

/* 	Note to myself: The first time I ran this command, it took a 
	considerable amount of time as the current dataset had almost 400 variables 
	and 1.2 million observations. Therefore, I decided to drop the variables 
	using stata rather than using iecodebook. 
	I will use the iecodebook only to re-label and re-code variables. */
