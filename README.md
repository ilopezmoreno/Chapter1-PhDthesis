# Chapter1-PhDthesis
 
This repository contains the replication package for the results obtained in the first chapter of my PhD thesis. 
"The relationship between economic development and female labour force participation: micro-level evidence from Mexico"

To replicate my results just follow these steps:
1) Save all the do-files included in this repository using the exact name for each file, and save them all together in the same folder on your computer.
2) Once you have saved all the do-file, open the master do file (1_dofile_master-script.do)
3) Replace my file path to my working directory, for the file path of the folder where you saved all the do-files in step 1.
   My file path to my working directory is: "C:/Users/d57917il/Documents/GitHub/Chapter1-PhDthesis". Please replace this with your own file path. 
4) Run the master dofile using Stata and you will be able to replicate the results that I have obtained so far.

Important note: 
The do-files were created using Stata 17. 
There is a chance that certain commands used in this do-file will not work if you are using a Stata version lower than 17. 
You can still try to run the do-files in other stata versions, but you will have to identify if there are some commands that are not working.

If you want an interpretation of the figures please check the following powerpoint presentation:
