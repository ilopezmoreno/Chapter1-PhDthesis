/* 	Two stages of data analysis: 
	
	• Exploratory data analysis: the research team will look for patterns 
	in the data, in a descriptive fashion
	
	• Final data analysis: the research team will decide on and compile 
	main results for research outputs, polish, and structure 
	
	During the exploratory data analysis, you shouldn't spend 
	significant time formatting tables and graphs. 
	You should spend time editing just the tables and graphs that the
	team chose to be presented in the paper, and this formatting shouldn't
	be done in this do-file. Instead, it should be done in separate do-files.
