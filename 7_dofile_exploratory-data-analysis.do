/* 	Two stages of data analysis: 
	• Exploratory data analysis: the research team will look for patterns 
	in the data, in a descriptive fashion
	• Final data analysis: the research team will decide on and compile 
	main results for research outputs, polish, and structure 
	
	The goal of data analysis is to document the process to produce the 
	tables and graphs that appear in the paper.
