/* 	Final data analysis is the "Stage Two" of exploratory data analysis 
	Getting outputs into publication-ready format is time consuming.
	Therefore, hard-code custom formatting should only be done after the team 
	has agreed what tables and graphs are going to be included in the report/paper.
	After that, you can spend time customizing those tables and graphs. 
	The goal is to reduce the number of times you will need to make very precise 
	adjustments to the code and aesthetics of the output. */
	
	
/*	Typically, you will need at least 4 separate do-files for this stage. 
		1) main_figures 
		2) main_tables 
		3) appendix_figures
		4) appendix_tables. 
	However, you can also have a separate do-file for each table or figure. */
